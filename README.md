# Norfrieds-Eldritch-Takeover
   A mod which adds inter-dimensional invasions by eldritch monstrosities! The creatures won't appear on their own, they must be awakened through a special interaction within a structure called the Forbidden Sanctum (not yet added to the world). The stronger you are, the stronger they become!

   This mod is still a work in progress, but the current vision is to create monsters that scale in difficulty with how powerful the player is. Depending on the player's advancements, items obtained, stats improved, and certain mods installed, the monsters health, attack damage, abilities, and other features will be adjusted accordingly with the goal of providing challenging but fair enemies for the player to fight regardless of their arsenal.


   What this mod adds as of 1/8/26:

Blocks
* Straulkite: A new stone-like material as hard as obsidian, which can be crafted into polished, brick, and tile variants.
   - Each variant comes with a complete set of stairs, slabs, walls, and a block or two unique to that set.
* Straulok Biomass: A dimly glowing mass of bio-material, crafted from Straulok Protoplasm.

Items
* Straulok Protoplasm: A strange living bio-material dropped from the various monsters, used to craft Straulok Biomass & another item...
* Burnt Straulok Protoplasm: A not so very safe to consume form of Straulok Protoplasm. Maybe there's a way to make it better?
* Straulok Crawler Eye: An edible drop from the Straulok Crawler (not recommended for consumption).
* Foreboding Relic: A mysterious ancient artifact with ties to forces beyond the natural.
* §¢€¥$¢€£ €$¢∆¥£§€¥: Beware the gaze of the all consuming...

Mobs
* Straulok Crawler: A spider-like abomination from beyond our known reality, able to leap great distances and inflict a terrible bite.


   Plans & features for the future:

   * The Forbidden Sanctum (A structure where the player can commence the Straulok Takeover)
   * More blocks and items to interact with.
   * A new block set from The $¢£ ¥£§€∆?..
   * A special block to initialize the invasion events from within the sanctum (Once you've activated it, the only way to deactivate it is to- Norfried gets pulled into a rift by an eldritch monster).
   * Invasion events with a randomly increasing chance of occurring each day (think the Bloodmoon from Terraria with a twist).
   * Temporary rifts/portals the monsters shall appear from during an invasion.
   * More unique otherworldly monsters to terrorize the player.
   * A scaling system for the monsters to remain as a challenge for the player, regardless of whether they have vanilla or modded arsenals & stats (their difficulty per player doesn't scale down without commands, only higher as the player gets stronger).
   * Unique potion effects revolving around the theme of reality warping (all but one are negative).
   * The ¥$€ §¢£¥¢?..
   * A boss monster worthy of an experienced player (which won't show up till after the player has defeated X number of invasions, along with the appropriate stats to trigger its arrival).
   * Integrations with other mods (EG: Thaumcraft, Ice & Fire, Game Stages, etc.).

   Note: NET (Norfried's Eldritch Takeover) was made for the 2025 1.12.2 Coalition Mod Jam, incomplete, but functional as far as I know (do report any & every issue that is found with the mod). Some features are exclusively obtainable in creative mode as of now, but eventually the player will be able to find/craft them in survival mode as well.
   Shoutout to SirSquidly for showing me how to run & use IntelliJ, JBoyMercs for letting me borrow portions of his code, Unoriginal for walking me through coding the crawler's unique AI, and Kombee for adding animations to a couple of items. This project wouldn't have been possible without them.

   Beware the ever hungry forces from beyond...
